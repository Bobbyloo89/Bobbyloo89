# About me

My name is **Mikael Lindstedt**, **35** years old and living in **Sweden**.
I'm currently studying at KYH to become a Front-End Developer.
My interests include sports of all kinds, gaming, reading, science, being in nature with my dog Toshi and I try to find different outlets for my creativity.
